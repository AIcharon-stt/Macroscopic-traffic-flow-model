# macroscopic-traffic-flow-model
This repository contains implementations of five common macroscopic traffic flow models for highway traffic simulation and prediction. Macroscopic traffic flow models treat traffic as a continuous fluid, simulating traffic dynamics by describing relationships between traffic density, speed, and flow.
